# Running the API Server

To start the API server locally, use the following command:

```sh
cd api && php -S localhost:8000
```

This will:

- Change directory to the `api` folder.
- Start a PHP built-in server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Make sure you have PHP installed on your system.
